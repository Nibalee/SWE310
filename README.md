**Project Description**

This Astronomy Chatbot Website  basically allows its users to ask predefined questions on astronomy and receive the correspondent answers.
The chatbot will check if the input of the user matches any of the predefined questions. In the case of a match, the chatbot will return the appropriate answers for the questions otherwise it will
express that it doesn't know the answer and prompt the user to try with another questions.

**Features:**

- Real-time Reponses: Immediate replies to user questions

**Technology Stack**
- HTML: Structuring the website
- CSS: for the styling of the UI
- JavaScript: Used to dynamically manipulate the style of a component
- .NET Framework

**Approach implemented:**
I started with the backend to ensure that the functionalities works perftly fine as it should with simply the basic HTML elements and ASP elements from the tools box. I then created the function that will return the answers based on the predefined questions.
I set the function to be a trigger the button is clicked. With everything set in place, I ensured that the chatbot workflow works as intended.

As the second phase of the approach, I moved to style UI and give it an aesthetic and pleasing UI for a better user experiece.
